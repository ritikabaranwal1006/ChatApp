Thanks for sharing the update! You are very close, but the screenshot shows a few small but important syntax mistakes in the Markdown code. This is why it's not looking right.

Let's fix it. I'll explain what's wrong and then give you the correct code to paste.

What Needs to Be Fixed:
Looking at your screenshot, here are the main issues:

Headings (#) are Missing: The lines for Step 2 and Step 3 are missing the ##### symbols in front. Without them, they are just plain text instead of becoming headings.

Code Blocks (```) are Incorrect: You have written the word Bash as normal text. The word bash should come immediately after the three backticks (```) to tell Markdown it's a code block. You are also missing the closing three backticks (```) to end the code block.

For example, this is what you have written:

Step 2: Start the Server
...
Bash
java Server
This is how it should be written in Markdown to work correctly:

Markdown

##### 🟢 Step 2: Start the Server
```bash
java Server

### ✅ The Final Correct Code

Don't worry about fixing it line by line. The easiest way is to **delete everything from `### ⚙️ How to Run` downwards** in your file and **replace it with the correct code below.**

Just copy and paste this entire block:

#### 🪜 Steps

##### 🔧 Step 1: Compile the Code
Open your terminal or command prompt in the `ChatApp` folder and run:
